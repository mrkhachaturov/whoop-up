# whoop-up

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/whoop-up.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/whoop-up)

CLI for WHOOP health data — fetch, analyze, and visualize via the WHOOP API v2.

```bash
npm install -g whoop-up
```

## Quick start

```bash
whoop auth login                                 # authenticate via browser
whoop summary --color                            # color-coded daily snapshot
whoop dashboard                                  # full dashboard + 7-day trends
whoop chart dashboard -n 30 -o /tmp/whoop.html  # interactive HTML chart
```

## Setup

1. Register a WHOOP application at [developer.whoop.com](https://developer.whoop.com)
   - Apps with fewer than 10 users don't need WHOOP review (immediate use)

2. Set environment variables — create a `.env` file in your working directory:

```env
WHOOP_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
WHOOP_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
WHOOP_REDIRECT_URI=https://your-redirect-uri.com/callback
```

3. Authenticate:

```bash
whoop auth login
```

Tokens are stored at `~/.whoop-up/tokens.json` and auto-refresh 15 minutes before expiry.

💡 Insights & Recommendations

🔴 Red Recovery
   Recovery at 13% — body needs rest.
   → Prioritize rest, hydration, and sleep tonight.

🔴 Significant Sleep Debt
   You have 2.1 hours of accumulated sleep debt.
   → Try to get to bed 30-60 min earlier for the next few days.

  }
}
```

## Token management

`whoop auth status` **does not refresh tokens** — it only reports expiry.

For cron jobs or automation:

```bash
# Recommended pattern
whoop auth refresh   # ensure fresh token before fetching
whoop dashboard --json
```

If refresh fails with an expired refresh token, re-authenticate interactively:

```bash
whoop auth login
```

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | General error |
| 2 | Authentication error |
| 3 | Rate limit exceeded |
| 4 | Network error |

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mrkhachaturov/whoop-up.git

npm run dev -- dashboard    # run without building
npm run build               # compile TypeScript → dist/
