  WHOOP CLI for health data, trends, insights, dashboards, and interactive charts.
  Use when user asks about WHOOP data, health metrics, recovery, HRV,
  sleep, strain, workouts, or wants to fetch/analyze/visualize WHOOP data.
  Also use when user says "whoop", "recovery score", "sleep score",
  "daily strain", "heart rate variability", "resting heart rate",
  "health dashboard", "health trends", "show me a chart", "health chart",
  or wants a daily health summary.
  Trigger on: "show my recovery", "how did I sleep", "fetch my WHOOP data",
  "health insights", "trend analysis", "visualize my health", "whoop chart".

# whoop-sync

Fetch, analyze, and visualize WHOOP health metrics via CLI: sleep, recovery, HRV, strain, workouts, and interactive charts.

Install: `npm install -g whoop-sync`

## Quick start

```bash
whoop-sync summary --color                            # color-coded daily snapshot
whoop-sync dashboard                                  # full dashboard + 7-day trends
whoop-sync trends --days 14                           # 14-day trend analysis
whoop-sync chart dashboard -n 30 -o /tmp/whoop.html  # interactive HTML chart
```

## Flags

| Flag | Applies to | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `-n, --days <number>` | data + analysis | Days of history (default: 7) |
| `-d, --date <date>` | data | Specific date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `-s, --start <date>` | data | Range start |
| `-e, --end <date>` | data | Range end |
| `-l, --limit <n>` | data | Max results per page (max: 25) |
| `-a, --all` | data | Fetch all pages |
| `-p, --pretty` | data | Human-readable output |
| `-c, --color` | summary | Color-coded status indicators |
| `--json` | dashboard, trends, insights | Raw JSON output |
| `-o, --output <file>` | chart | Save HTML to file instead of opening browser |
| `--sleep/--recovery/--workout/--cycle/--profile/--body` | global | Select data types |

## Key behaviors

- Data commands → JSON by default; add `--pretty` for formatted output
- Analysis commands → pretty by default; add `--json` for raw data
- WHOOP day boundary is **4:00 AM**, not midnight
- Tokens stored at `~/.whoop-sync/tokens.json`, auto-refresh 15 min before expiry
- `trends --days` only accepts **7, 14, or 30**
- `chart` commands open browser automatically; use `-o file.html` to save instead
- `get sleep <id>` — id is a UUID string; `get cycle <id>` — id is an integer
- Rate limits: **100 req/min**, 10,000 req/day — avoid rapid repeated calls

## Answering questions

| User asks | Command |
| --- | --- |
| "How did I sleep last night?" | `whoop-sync dashboard --json` |
| "What's my recovery today?" | `whoop-sync summary --color` |
| "Show me my health overview" | `whoop-sync dashboard` |
| "How are my trends this week?" | `whoop-sync trends --days 7 --json` |
| "Analyze last 30 days" | `whoop-sync trends --days 30 --json` |
| "What are my health insights?" | `whoop-sync insights` |
| "Show me a chart / visualize my health" | `whoop-sync chart dashboard -n 30 -o /tmp/whoop.html` |
| "Show HRV chart" | `whoop-sync chart hrv -n 30 -o /tmp/whoop-hrv.html` |
| "Is my HRV improving?" | `whoop-sync trends --days 14 --json` |
| "How much did I train this week?" | `whoop-sync workout -n 7 --pretty` |
| "What was my sleep on 2026-01-15?" | `whoop-sync sleep -d 2026-01-15 --pretty` |
| "Show all data for last month" | `whoop-sync --sleep --recovery --cycle --workout -n 30 --pretty` |

## Key metrics

- **Recovery** (0–100%): Green ≥67%, Yellow 34–66%, Red <34%
- **Strain** (0–21): Daily exertion. Optimal target: Green day ~14, Yellow ~10, Red ~6
- **HRV** (ms): Higher = better recovery. Track vs personal baseline, not population norms
- **RHR** (bpm): Lower = better fitness. Rising RHR signals fatigue or illness
- **Sleep Performance** (%): Actual sleep vs. sleep needed. Green ≥85%, Yellow ≥70%
- **Sleep Efficiency** (%): Time asleep / time in bed. Target ≥85%
- **SpO2** (%): Blood oxygen. Normal 95–100%. Values <94% warrant attention
- **Skin temp** (°C): Deviation from personal baseline — elevation may signal illness

## Health analysis

When the user asks about health, trends, or wants deeper interpretation, use `references/health_analysis.md` for:
- Science-backed interpretation of HRV, RHR, sleep stages, recovery, strain, SpO2
- Normal ranges by age and fitness level
- Pattern detection (sleep debt, overtraining signals, day-of-week effects)
- Actionable recommendations based on data
- Red flags that suggest medical consultation

### Analysis workflow
1. **Status** — `whoop-sync summary --color` (today's snapshot)
2. **Trends** — `whoop-sync trends --days 14 --json` (direction of key metrics)
3. **Patterns** — correlate: late workouts → poor sleep, high strain → low HRV next day
4. **Insights** — `whoop-sync insights` (automated recommendations)
5. **Flags** — RHR rising >5 bpm, HRV <80% of 7-day average, SpO2 <94%

Always include: *"This is not medical advice."*

## God mode: composite commands for deep insights

**Best single command for LLM analysis:**
```bash
whoop-sync dashboard --json
```
Most data-dense: today's full snapshot (profile + recovery + sleep + cycle + workout) plus 7-day arrays of recovery, sleep, and cycle history — all in one JSON blob.

**Full daily picture (formatted for human reading):**
```bash
whoop-sync dashboard        # today + 7-day terminal dashboard
whoop-sync insights         # health recommendations
```

**30-day deep dive (maximum historical context):**
```bash
whoop-sync trends --days 30 --json
whoop-sync sleep -n 30 --all --pretty
whoop-sync recovery -n 30 --all --pretty
whoop-sync workout -n 30 --all --pretty
```

**Visual analysis (save charts to files):**
```bash
whoop-sync chart dashboard -n 30 -o /tmp/whoop-dashboard.html
whoop-sync chart hrv -n 90 -o /tmp/whoop-hrv.html
whoop-sync chart sleep -n 30 -o /tmp/whoop-sleep.html
whoop-sync chart recovery -n 30 -o /tmp/whoop-recovery.html
```

**Drill into a specific record (use IDs from `dashboard --json` output):**
```bash
whoop-sync get sleep <uuid>          # full detail for one sleep record
whoop-sync get cycle <id>            # full detail for one day's cycle
whoop-sync cycle-sleep <cycleId>     # sleep linked to that cycle
whoop-sync cycle-recovery <cycleId>  # recovery linked to that cycle
```

**Recommended god mode workflow:**
1. `whoop-sync dashboard --json` — current state + 7-day history
2. `whoop-sync trends --days 30 --json` — 30-day trend context
3. `whoop-sync --sleep --recovery --workout --cycle -n 30 --all` — raw data for all key metrics
4. Feed all JSON to LLM: correlate HRV↔sleep, recovery↔strain, sleep duration↔workout performance
5. `whoop-sync chart dashboard -n 30 -o /tmp/whoop.html` — visual confirmation

💡 Insights & Recommendations

🔴 Red Recovery
   Recovery at 13% — body needs rest.
   → Prioritize rest, hydration, and sleep tonight.

🔴 Significant Sleep Debt
   You have 2.1 hours of accumulated sleep debt.
   → Try to get to bed 30-60 min earlier for the next few days.
